$f(x)$ is another way of expressing $y$, when making an equation or graph. We call this functions.
For instance $f(x)=2x+5$, is the same thing as $y=2x+5$.

Anything that can be expressed in the form of $y=$ can be represented as a function, and can be written as $f(x)=$.

Definition-wise, $f(x)$ means "function of $x$", which means $f(w)$ means "function of w"!

Identifying functions are easy. First of all, if it can be expressed in the form of $y=$, then it's very likely a function. If you are still not sure, you can check using the vertical line test.
To do the vertical line test, you first have to draw a graph. I'd personally recommend Desmos or Geogebra. However, I still strongly recommend you to use the one you are familiar with, or doing a test with (e.g. 91257).

When you've drawn a function, send a few 'vertical lines through the graph you drew'. Just like this:
![|300](Pasted%20image%2020251017104610.png)

Now, check if each vertical line (blue in the image) goes through the function (orange) once. If ANY vertical line goes through the function at any point twice or more, then it cannot be a function.

Here are examples of non-functions:

Functions are basically systems where if one goes in, another comes out.
A function can only have **1 $y$-value per $x$-coordinate**. If $x$ goes in, only 'one' $y$ should come out.

Functions are widely used in calculus, so it's worth knowing them!
