L2 Calculus' outline looks like this:
- Differentiation
	- Optimization
- Integration (anti-differentiation)
- Kinematics
- other stuff that is pure hell

Calculus mainly deals with cubic functions, but any other functions with a maximim/minimum point appears as well!

In 'very simple terms', differentiation is about finding the gradient, integration is reverse-differentiating/finding area underneath a graph.
Optimization is a branch off differentiation: you are mainly asked to maximize/minimize something like area, dimension, length, etc..
Kinematics is pure evil; it is about dealing with displacement (distance), velocity (speed), and acceleration/deceleration.

"Other stuffs that are pure hell" are questions that deal with two+ unknown variables like this one below:
$$f(x)=ax^{3}+bx^{2}+cx+d$$
There also are other stuffs that are hell.
